\begin{frame}{Ionisation and scintillation in Xe}
$\bullet$~When a charged particle propagates through a noble gas the Coulomb interaction with the atoms result in ionisation of the medium, releasing on average \nne\ electron-ion pairs:

\[
\nne = \frac{E}{W_I}
\]
where $E$ is the energy deposited by in the medium and $W_I$ is the average energy required to produce one electron-ion pair. In xenon gas $W_I=21.9$~eV (\url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02435})


$\bullet$~ The propagation of a charged particle in a noble gas also results in the emission of VUV scintillation
light (with an average wavelength of 172 nm in xenon). Defining $W_s$ as the average energy needed in the
creation of one primary scintillation photon, the average number of scintillation photons produced when a
particle releases its energy E in the gas is:

\[
\nng = \frac{E}{W_s}
\]
In xenon gas $W_s =76 \pm 6$~eV (NEXT collaboration).

$\bullet~$ The principle of the GPSC (Conde and Policarpo, 1967) is as follows. An X-ray enters through the chamber window and is absorbed in a region of weak electric field known as the drift region. 

$\bullet~$ The ionisation electrons drift under such field to a region
of moderately high electric field (around 3 kV cm$^{-1}\cdot$ bar$^{-1}$ the so-called scintillation or EL region. 

$\bullet~$ There, each electron is accelerated so that it excites, but does not ionise, the gas atoms/molecules. The excited
atoms decay, emitting UV light (the so-called secondary scintillation), which is detected by photosensors.

\]
where the reduced electroluminescence yield is defined as the number of photons emitted per primary
electron and per unit of drift length divided by the pressure of the gas, and$E/p$ is expressed in
kV$\cdot$cm$^{-1}\cdot$bar$^{-1}$. The formula was found to be in good agreement with experimental data measured at 1 bar.

$\bullet~$ In \XE\, the energy released in a \qbb\ event is 2458 keV. 

$\bullet~$ This corresponds to $2458/76 = 32\ 342$~primary scintillation photons, distributed on a time of about 40 ns. Even with a modest light collection efficiency $\sim 1$\%, this result in a very clear signal, as in figures above.  

$\bullet~$ The number of ionisation electrons is $2458/21.9 = 112\ 237$. Assuming that all those electrons are collected and amplified in the EL region, and assuming an EL gain of the order of 10$^3$, one gets $\sim 10^8$ EL photons. With a light collection efficiency of $\sim 1$\%, this result in about 10$^6$ photons, distributed over the length of the track.  

 $\bullet~$  The path length of the track depends on the gas pressure. In the case of a \bbonu\ event, one has two electrons with $\qbb = 2458 keV$, which move through the gas losing energy by ionisation and twisting around due to Coulomb MS. Eventually, they reach de Bragg Peak, near the end of their range and stop. The average path length (in z) at 10 bar is about 10 cm, which corresponds to about 100 $\mu$s, see figure.

 $\bullet~$ Use Bette-Block equation for ionisation loss to estimate the path length of an electron with energy \qbb\ in gas xenon at 10 bar. BB formula is:

\]

Where:

- \( K \): Constant factor (\(K \approx 0.307 \, \mathrm{MeV \, cm^2 / mol}\))

- \( Z \): Atomic number of xenon (\(Z = 54\))

- \( A \): Atomic mass of \XE\ (\(A \approx 137 \, \mathrm{g/mol}\))

- \( p \): Pressure of the xenon gas w.r.t.  \( p_0 \) (reference pressure, usually 1 atm). 
%- \( p_0 \): Reference pressure (usually 1 atm or 1 bar)
%- \( \beta \): Velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light (\(v/c\))
%- \( \gamma \): Lorentz factor, \(\gamma = (1 - \beta^2)^{-1/2}\)
%- \( m_e \): Mass of the electron (\(m_e c^2 \approx 0.511 \, \mathrm{MeV}\))

- \( T_{\text{max}} \): Maximum kinetic energy that can be transferred to a free electron in a collision.

%
%  \[
%  T_{\text{max}} = \frac{2 m_e c^2 \beta^2 \gamma^2}{1 + 2 \gamma m_e / M}

 \column{0.60\textwidth}
$\bullet$~As discussed in Lecture 1, excellent energy resolution is a crucial ingredient for a  \bbonu\ experiment. 

$\bullet$~Figure (from Bolotnikov, 97) shows the energy resolution (FWHM)  for  662 keV gamma rays, as a function of xenon density, for the ionisation signal only.

$\bullet$~ Observe the transition at density
$\rho_t \sim 0.55{\mbox{g/cm}^3}$. Below this density, the energy resolution is approximately constant:
$\delta E/E = 6 \times 10^{-3} {\rm ~FWHM}$. For densities greater than $\rho_t$, energy resolution deteriorates rapidly, approaching a plateau at LXe density.

$\bullet$~ Extrapolating (as $1/\sqrt{E}$) to the \XE\ \qbb\ leads to
$\delta E/E = 3 \times 10^{-3} {\rm ~FWHM}$.

\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Intrinsic energy resolution in xenon: GXe vs LXe}
$\bullet$~ Bolotnikov experiment shows: a) that the intrinsic resolution that can be achieved in a GXe TPC at \qbb\ (measuring ionisation only) is very small (0.3 \% FWHM), and b) that measuring ionisation only yields a mediocre value of the energy resolution for a LXe TPC ($\sim 5$\% at 660 keV). 

$\bullet$~This, in turn, implies: a) that a GXe TPC aiming to maximise energy resolution (a must for \bbonu\ experiments) must try to preserve the excellent energy resolution in gas, and b) that LXe TPC must do something else to improve their energy resolution (spoiler: measure primary scintillation and use the anticorrelation between ionisation and scintillation).  
\end{frame}

$\bullet$~The first term in equation \ref{eq:res}, $R(Fano)$, correspond to the intrinsic resolution in xenon ($F_{\rm GXe} = 0.15 \pm 0.02$).

$\bullet$~ The second term, $R(EL)$~to the resolution associated to fluctuations in

$ \bar{N}_{ep} = k\ \bar{N}_e\ \bar{N}_{EL}$, 
%
where $k$~is the fraction of EL photons produced per \bbonu\ decay that gives rise to the production of a photoelectron.

$\bullet$~Figure shows the EL yield and energy resolution, $R_E$ as a function of the reduced electric field of a HPXe EL TPC operating at 10 bar for the energy corresponding to \qbb. Notice that $R(Fano)$~is constant, $R(EL)$~is essentially negligible and $R(EP)$~improves quickly with the reduced field E/P. A typical value of operation for
E/P is such that $R(Fano) = R(EL)$ ($E/P \sim 2$). The combined resolution at this value
is around 0.5\% FWHM and the yield around $500$ photons per electron. Increasing $E/P$ results in very little resolution improvement.

\begin{frame}{What about avalanche multiplication?}

$\bullet$~Two problems: 1) the fluctuation in the gain, $G$, is considerably larger than $F$~in EL multiplication, and thus becomes the dominant term in the resolution. 2) electron multiplication in pure xenon is difficult, due to the fact that VUV scintillation light, copiously produced with the multiplication process, ejects electron from metallic surfaces defining the electrodes. Those electrons, in turn, ionise the gas to the point of breakdown.

$\bullet$~The use of quenchers, on the other hand, suppresses the primary scintillation light. Without primary scintillation is not possible to define \tz\ and thus a fiducial volume cannot be well defined and the experiment becomes pray of backgrounds arising from the metal grids. ``Magic gases'', capable to absorb the VUV light emitted by xenon and re-emit it at a more manageable wavelength (e.g., in the visible region), without introducing extra fluctuations, have been sought, so far without success.

$\bullet$~Another possibility is to use micro-pattern devices, such as Micromegas  or GEMs whose confined geometrical structure makes them capable to operate at high pressure without quenchers.

$\bullet$~This possibility was explored as a part of NEXT R\&D.
While Micromegas were found, indeed,
robust enough to allow operation in pure xenon and at high pressures, their resolution was measured to degrade with increased pressure. It was found that the resolution attainable at \qbb\ by  micro-bulk micromegas at 10 bar would be $3\%$, to be compared with that of $0.5\%$ found by DBDM.

$\bullet~$ In an HPXe at moderate pressures (5-20) bar, electrons leave a very distinctive signature. They are ``single head worms". The tail of the worm is the mip trajectory, while the head corresponds to the high energy deposit at the end of the range (Bragg peak). Double electrons, instead, have ``two heads".  

%$\bullet~$ The capability to reconstruct the electron(s) trajectory implies that in an HPXe one does not have ``pileup background'' (e.g., overlap of two signals coming from a chain decay) as in dense calorimeters. This, combined with the fiducialization of the volume that allows the S1 implies that only gammas which produce a photoelectric or Compton electron in the gas, with \qbb\ energy are relevant.

$\bullet~$As the ionisation electrons (and the positive ions) drift towards the anode (cathode) under the action of the electric field, they interact with the noble gas atoms, resulting in both longitudinal and transverse diffusion.

$\bullet~$ Defining
$\mathcal{N}_e$~ as the density of electrons per unit volume, $D_{L(T)}$~ as the longitudinal (transverse) diffusion coefficient(s), $v_d$~ as the drift velocity and $\eta$~ as the attachment coefficient one can write (choosing $z = 0$~as the coordinate of the amplification plane, and assuming that all charge arrives at a fixed time, $t - t_0 \simeq z/v_d$):

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{N}_e(x',y',z') =  \frac{e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x'-x}{D_T^{\sqrt{z}}})^2} e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{y'-y}{D_T^{\sqrt{z}}})^2} e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{z'}{D_L^{\sqrt{z}}})^2}}{(2\pi D_T^{2} z)(2\pi D_L^{2} z)^{1/2}}\times

where $D_{L,T} = \sqrt{2D_{L,T}/v_d}$. 

$\bullet~$ Electrons produced in a \bbonu\ decay are extended track in a HPXe detector. One can still make use of  eq. \ref{THESOL3} making the approximation that the track consists in a superposition of point-like energy depositions that arrive at successive times to the anode.

As a consequence, the ionisation electrons produced by tracks located at relatively long distances from the anode will have spread considerably both in the longitudinal and transverse coordinates, and the resulting reconstructed image of the track will be consequently blurred. 
%This undesirable effect can be limited by using mixtures that add a quencher capable of cooling the diffusion electrons and therefore reduce the diffusion.
%Alas, all known quenchers also absorb the scintillation light emitted by xenon, introducing the problems discussed above. The problem and potential solutions is discussed in section XX.
