$\bullet~$ Double beta decay is a rare nuclear transition in which a nucleus with Z protons decays into a nucleus with Z + 2 protons and the same mass number A. The decay can occur only if the initial nucleus is less bound than the final nucleus, and both more than the intermediate one.

$\bullet~$ Such a condition is fulfilled by 35 nuclides in nature because of the nuclear pairing force ensuring that nuclei with even Z and N are more bound than the odd-odd nuclei with the same A = Z + N.

$\bullet~$ Being a second-order process in $G_F$, the lifetime of $\beta\beta2\nu$ processes is very long ($\sim 10^{20}$~y in Xe).

\tonu. To obtain the sensitivity to the physical parameter \mbbsq, one can simply write:
\[
\mbbsq = \frac{\tonu}{\gonu\cdot\monu}

$\tonu \sim 10^{27}$~y and $\tonu \sim 10^{28}$~y. Which range of \mbb\ do you obtain? What do you conclude?

$\bullet~$ Let us build a toy detector based on xenon. The vessel will be made of ultra-low radioactivity copper. The best such materials have activities in the chain of
${}^{238}$U of the order o 3 $\mu$Bq/kg. Assume that your pressure vessel is a cylinder with walls (and end-caps) 10 cm thick. Design the dimensions of the pressure vessel to contain one ton of xenon at 20 bar and one one of LXe. Then, compute the mass of your vessel and from that the total activity (in both cases). 

$\bullet~$ Refine your calculation computing only the activity that enters the active xenon volume. This means that you need to take into account geometrical and self-shielding effects. Write a small Monte Carlo to do the calculation or use analytical approximations.

$\bullet~$ Which activity do you get? What do you conclude from there?

%\begin{frame}{Exercise 5}
%
%$\bullet~$ Assuming that your material is in equilibrium, all decays of ${}^{238}$U will lead to
%${}^{214}$Bi. About 1.5 \% of ${}^{214}$Bi decays will produce a gamma of energy 2.48 MeV, which is very close to \XE\ \qbb\ and thus becomes a very dangerous background. Assuming the activity in the steel in the exercise 4, you can compute now the total number of gammas of 2.48 MeV that cross the xenon volume. A fraction of those gammas will interact in the gas. You can compute that fraction using the NIST (\url{https://www.nist.gov/pml/x-ray-and-gamma-ray-data}) tables or Geant4. How many interactions do you get? What do you conclude?

$\bullet~$ Write now, $b = c \cdot M \cdot t \cdot \Delta E$, where c is rate (assumed constant) of events in the ROI, defined by the resolution $\Delta E$. Then:

 \begin{frame}{The $\beta$ term and $\epsilon$}

 $\bullet~$ Not all parameters can be optimised at the same time. Notice that a possible approach is to go for very large masses (KamLAND-Zen, SNO+), while another is to bet on extremely good energy resolution (GERDA/LEGEND). Other experiments may try a combination of the three parameters (NEXT, NEXO, CUPID). One can even, conceivably try an approach in which $c \sim 0$ (NEXT-BOLD).
