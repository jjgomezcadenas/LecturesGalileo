\begin{enumerate}
\item Give a qualitative argument (using neutrino helicity) to argue that the amplitude of  $\beta\beta0\nu$ must be proportional to m$_{\beta\beta}$, and thus lifetime proportional to $m_{\beta\beta}^2$
\item Make a list of suitable $\beta\beta0\nu$ isotopes. Compare them in terms of $Q_{\beta\beta}$, sensitivity of T$_{\beta\beta0\nu}$~to m$_{\beta\beta}$ (use the $M^{0\nu}$~and $G^{0\nu}$~ shown in lecture1-5 ), as well as in termos of availability, feasibility of enrichment, etc. 
\item Describe (very briefly) possible experimental techniques to exploit $\beta\beta0\nu$ isotopes. For example, one can build a Xenon TPC, using ${}^{136}Xe$. Give examples for as many isotopes as you can.  
\end{enumerate}
